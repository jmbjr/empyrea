A number of tiles have been taken and/or modified from Jerom's 32x32 tileset (http://opengameart.org/content/32x32-fantasy-tileset).
Small scroll by 'ba1969' (http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1328513).

The following artists' work was used for various graphics: andreyutzu (http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1150764), brokenarts (http://www.sxc.hu/photo/432896), gilderm (http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1389219)

A HUGE thanks goes to RPGMapShare.com, and to Steel Rat, who created many of the flora graphics in the game.

A number of miscellaneous images were taken from stock.xchng, which is a great resource for stock photos. Please visit and endorse it!

An image from fantasymapmaker.com was used for the loading screens.

Part of (or All) the graphic tiles used in this program is the public 
domain roguelike tileset "RLTiles".
Some of the tiles have been modified.

You can find the original tileset at:

Some characters were used from the DF tileset repository (http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Tileset_repository). Dwarf Fortress is an awesome game.

Some tiles (notably castle walls) are by 'The Sim' at dundjinni.com, which is a great resource for anybody looking for graphical tiles for map-making or games.

GUI icons are from game-icons.net. Go look; it is awesome.
